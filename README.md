volaupload.sh
=============

This is a bash script that allows you to upload files to volafile without using the
browser. This is convinient since it allows you aslo to upload files with different
name to boost your shitposing experience. Use -h or --help command for full list
of capabilities.

Disclaimer
----------

Script was orginally made by [lain](https://github.com/laino) and Xiao. It seemed
abandoned so I enchanted it with adding agrument parsing and some other features.

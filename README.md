volaupload.sh
=============

This is a bash script that allows you to upload files to [Volafile](https://volafile.io) 
without using the browser. This is convenient, since it allows you to upload
files with different names without a need to rename them beforehand.
Use -h or --help command for full list of capabilities.

Disclaimer
----------

Script was originally made by [lain](https://github.com/laino) and Xiao. It seemed
to be abandoned so I enhanced it with agrument parsing and some other features.
